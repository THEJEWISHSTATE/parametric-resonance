**Quantifying alignment between ethical frameworks through parametric resonance**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

The Φ (Phi) framework provides mathematical tools to measure **parametric resonance**—how similarly different AI models or ethical frameworks respond to shared inputs.

## 🔬 Core Concept

Instead of auditing outcomes (reactive), Φ measures **parametric alignment** (proactive). Two systems with high Φ resonance will respond similarly to novel inputs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Φ-men/parametric-resonance.git
cd parametric-resonance
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/basic_usage.py
🎯 Research Applications
For ML Researchers
Measure resonance between differently-trained models

Quantify transfer learning compatibility

For Ethics Researchers
Compare parametric signatures of ethical frameworks

Identify alignment/misalignment before deployment

For Policymakers
Objective metrics for algorithmic audit

Standardization of fairness measurements

📊 Example Usage
python
from src.phi_resonance.metrics.phi import PhiMetric

calculator = PhiMetric()
model_a_params = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
model_b_params = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]

phi_value = calculator.compute(model_a_params, model_b_params)
print(f"Φ resonance: {phi_value:.3f}")
