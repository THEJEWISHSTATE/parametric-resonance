# Research Roadmap

## Short-term (1-3 months)
- Mathematical validation of Φ metric
- Benchmarking against existing fairness metrics
- Case study: Comparing 3 ethical frameworks

## Medium-term (3-6 months)  
- Cross-cultural validation studies
- Integration with popular ML frameworks
- Protocol for multi-stakeholder calibration

## Open Questions for Collaboration
1. What are minimal universal fairness dimensions?
2. How does Φ correlate with real-world outcomes?
3. What are appropriate thresholds for deployment?

## Getting Involved
Open an Issue or start a Discussion with your area of expertise.
